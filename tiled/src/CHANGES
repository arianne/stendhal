0.0.1 - December 6th, 2005

* restarted versioning from scratch (new name too)
* fixed a bunch of compiler warnings (unused imports/variables, stuff like that)
* overall cleanup
* biggest change: the code is java 1.5.0 now. never look back.
* added a new panel with tabs for each tileset (removed the tileset button)
* added selecting multiple tiles from the tileset. The brush now draws all
  selected tiles at once
* added memory monitor
* properly implemented the minimap
* properly implemented brushes
* properly implemented builders
* refactored mapview system
* refactored action system
* support for custom brushes (single and multilayer)
* refactored the plugin system
* updated GUI for managing tile properties


Broken things:
* some undo features (delete/rename layer, maybe: properties layer changes, map/layer/tile props)
* pour (won't fix, replaced by brushes. maybe a pour brush?)
* select all/none/invert
* plugins

Todo:
* there are some ugly scrolling issues. scroll is separate thread? check SwingWorker and SwingUtilities.invokeLater
* when using positive zoom there are some problems with invalidating?
* improve selection
* fix plugins
* correctly implement loading/saving plugin
* remove the setMap()-methods in all panels and use a listener callback instead
* return real brushes in Map.getUserBrushes();

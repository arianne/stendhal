/**
 * QUEST: Pizza Delivery
 * <p>
 * PARTICIPANTS:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Leander (the baker in Semos)
 * <li> NPC's all over the world (as customers)
 * </ul>
 *
 * STEPS:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Leander gives you a pizza and tells you who ordered it, and how much
 * time you have to deliver.
 * <li> As a gimmick, you get a pizza delivery uniform.
 * <li> You walk to the customer and say "pizza".
 * <li> The customer takes the pizza. If you were fast enough, you get a tip.
 * <li> You put on your original clothes automatically.
 * </ul>
 * REWARD:
 * <ul>
 * <li> XP (Amount varies depending on customer. You only get half of the XP if
 * the pizza has become cold.)
 * <li> some karma if delivered on time (5)
 * <li> gold coins (As a tip, if you were fast enough; amount varies depending
 * on customer.)
 * </ul>
 *
 * REPETITIONS:
 * <ul>
 * <li> As many as wanted, but you can't get a new task while you still have the
 * chance to do the current delivery on time.
 * </ul>

						"Or'ril Castle is one of a series of such castles built to defend the imperial road between #Ados and #Deniran. When in use, it housed a fighting force of around 60 swordsmen, plus ancillary staff. Now that most of the Empire's army has been sent south to fend off the invaders, the castle has been abandoned by the military. As far as I'm aware, it should be empty; I hear some rumours, though...");

				.addReply(
						"Nalwor",
						"Nalwor is an ancient elven city, built deep inside the forest to the southeast of us long before humans ever arrived on this island. Elves don't like mixing with other races, but we're given to understand that Nalwor was built to help defend their capital city of Teruykeh against an evil force.");

Most of the Empire's main trade routes with other countries originate in this city, then extending north through #Ados, and south to Sikhw. Unfortunately, the southern routes were been destroyed when Blordrough and his armies conquered Sikhw, some time ago now.");

				.addReply(
						"use",
						"Once you #get a map, there are three scales on which you need to understand it. Firstly, there are the map #levels, then you need to familiarize yourself with the #naming conventions for the different zones within those levels, and lastly you should learn how we describe a person's #positioning within a zone. We'll have you navigating around in no time!");

		npc
				.addReply(
						"levels",
						"Maps are split into levels according to the height of that particular area above or below the surface. Areas on the surface are at level 0. The level number is the first thing in a map's name. For instance, #Semos itself is at ground level, so it is level 0; its map is called \"0_semos_city\". The first level of the dungeon beneath us is at level -1, so its map is called \"-1_semos_dungeon\". You should note, though, that a map of a building's interior will usually have the level at the end of the name instead, with \"int\" (for \"interior\") at the start. For instance, the upstairs floor of the tavern would be mapped out as \"int_semos_tavern_1\".");

		npc
				.addReply(
						"naming",
						"Each map is usually split up into \"sets\" of zones, with a central feature that is used as a reference point. The zones surrounding this central zone are named by the direction in which they lie from it. For instance, from the central zone \"0_semos_city\", you can travel west to the old village at \"0_semos_village_w\", or you could travel two zones north and one west to the mountains at \"0_semos_mountain_n2_w\".");

		npc
				.addReply(
						"positioning",
						"Positioning within a zone is simply described in terms of co-ordinates. We conventionally take the top-left corner (that is, the northwest corner) to be the origin point with co-ordinates (0, 0). The first co-ordinate ('x') increases as you move to the right (that is, east) within the zone, and the second co-ordinate ('y') increases as you move down (that is, south).");
